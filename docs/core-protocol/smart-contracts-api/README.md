# Interface Reference

### Where you can find them
This section of the docs is generated automatically from the smart contract interfaces which can be found in the main Unlock github repository [here](https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock/tree/master/smart-contracts/contracts/interfaces).

### How they can be used

By importing the contract interfaces directly into your own smart contracts they then can be used to create functionality such as:

- Implementing paid only features
- Granting access to resources by granting keys 
- Granting access to resources by lending keys
- Withdrawing funds
- Issuing trials or refunds
- Assigning roles or titles

For more inspiration and example usage see the "Smart Contracts" section of the [tutorials](/tutorials/) section.

If you're new to smart contract development checkout these resources on Solidity contract interfaces for more information.
