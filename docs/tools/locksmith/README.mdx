description: Summary of the Locksmith service, a development tool for Unlock Protocol.
---

Locksmith is a hosted API service providing an array of functionality which are not part of the core protocol, but are useful for onboarding. These tools can (and should!) be replaced by 3rd party applications who want to implement the protocol natively.

Locksmith powers the following functionality at the moment.

- Store metadata for locks, keys, and users
- Automated NFT membership renewals
- Fiat payment integration
- Ticket management
- Webhooks triggered when keys and locks are created
- Sending emails, generating QR codes, and other miscellanous tasks.
